# T-019 — Graceful rebind on configuration change

> Phase 01 · Core server · **Depends on:** T-018, T-013 · **Parallel-safe:** yes · **Est. agent time:** 40-80 min

## Goal

Changing port or bind mode while running performs a drain → rebind → resume instead of a hard restart.

## Read first (context budget)

- [`status/NEXT.md`](../../status/NEXT.md) — the next task and the pre-flight commands
- [`status/ERRORS.md`](../../status/ERRORS.md) — must have no open entry for this task
- [`handbooks/09-skill-resolution.md`](../../handbooks/09-skill-resolution.md) — what each skill label below means on this machine
- [`docs/11-tbc-resolutions.md`](../../docs/11-tbc-resolutions.md) — decisions already settled; not re-opened
- this file, top to bottom, plus the *Acceptance criteria* of every `Depends on` task

Do not read the rest of the plan to "get oriented" — the entry point is this file plus the documents linked here. If the work genuinely needs another document, read that one and nothing more.

## Skills (≥2 in parallel via subagents)

| Skill | Subagent role |
|---|---|
| `ktor-server` | drain semantics, readiness flag, minimal client-visible gap |
| `testing` | test that an in-flight request completes across a rebind |

Verification is never skipped. If you substitute a skill, log it — see [handbooks/02-subagent-orchestration.md](../../handbooks/02-subagent-orchestration.md).

## Deliverables

- `server/Rebind.kt` implementing the drain/rebind/resume sequence
- Readiness flag reflected in `/health` during the gap

## Steps

1. Stop accepting new connections, let in-flight requests finish within a bounded window.
2. Release the old socket, bind the new configuration, flip readiness back on.
3. If the new bind fails, return to the previous working configuration and report the failure.
4. Log one record per rebind with old and new configuration.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] An in-flight request completes successfully across a rebind
- [ ] A failing rebind rolls back to the previous configuration, still serving
- [ ] The rebind is logged with both configurations

## Verification

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*Rebind*'
```

## Definition of done

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion above is ticked **and** was actually run
- [ ] The *Verification* commands above passed unmodified (pasting a raw result into `logs/tasks/T-019.log`)
- [ ] No placeholder, no invented endpoint/URL/model/field, no edit outside the files this task names
- [ ] Nothing was weakened to make a check pass (no deleted test, no raised threshold, no disabled rule)
- [ ] `status/PROGRESS.md` and `status/NEXT.md` updated in the same commit as the work
- [ ] `scripts/preflight-secrets.sh` clean
- [ ] UI work only: `python3 tools/check_design_slop.py` passes and the four craft tests ran ([docs/14-design-system.md](../../docs/14-design-system.md) §11)

## Rules that always apply

- Prohibitions and the quality bar: [handbooks/07-anti-slop-rules.md](../../handbooks/07-anti-slop-rules.md) (placeholders, invented endpoints, unrequested scope, weakened checks)
- At least two skills **in parallel** as subagents, one of them verification: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) §4
- Log every meaningful step, commit and push exactly once for this task: [handbooks/05-logging-standard.md](../../handbooks/05-logging-standard.md) · [handbooks/04-git-protocol.md](../../handbooks/04-git-protocol.md)
- No secret in the repository, ever: `scripts/preflight-secrets.sh` must pass
- A new dependency, a deviation, or a settled decision goes into [status/DECISIONS.md](../../status/DECISIONS.md) in the same commit
- Missing tool for the job? Search before improvising: [handbooks/08-tooling-discovery.md](../../handbooks/08-tooling-discovery.md)

## Logging & Git

Protocols: [handbooks/04-git-protocol.md](../../handbooks/04-git-protocol.md) · [handbooks/05-logging-standard.md](../../handbooks/05-logging-standard.md)

- `scripts/log-step.sh T-019 "<action>" "<result>"` after every meaningful step
- `scripts/log-step.sh T-019 "test" "<command>" "pass" --actor verify` for each verification run
- Once every criterion above is ticked: `scripts/step-commit.sh "T-019: Graceful rebind on configuration change"`
- Update [status/PROGRESS.md](../../status/PROGRESS.md) and [status/NEXT.md](../../status/NEXT.md) in the same commit

## State after success

Port and bind-mode changes are safe to make while agents are connected.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report — do not improvise around these:

- A criterion fails after one honest repair attempt → append to [status/ERRORS.md](../../status/ERRORS.md) and stop the chain.
- This task contradicts [docs/11-tbc-resolutions.md](../../docs/11-tbc-resolutions.md) → the task is wrong: fix this file, log why, continue.
- A user-visible decision is needed that no document settles → stop and ask, naming the decision and the options.
- A provider's documentation or endpoint is unreachable → record exactly what was tried. **Never invent a URL, a model id or a field name.**
- The same environmental failure happens twice → stop; the third attempt is guessing.

## Handover

If this task is interrupted, append a `STOPPED:` note to [status/ERRORS.md](../../status/ERRORS.md) (template in [handbooks/06-resume-protocol.md](../../handbooks/06-resume-protocol.md)) describing the last completed step, the state of the working tree, and the next action. The next agent resumes from `logs/tasks/T-019.log`.
